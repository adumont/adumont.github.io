This page is a work in progress, as most of the projects listed here...


- [AD6502](https://github.com/adumont/ad6502), a project with a 6502 core, a QT GUI, ram/rom and GPIO, in the icezum Alhambra FPGA

- [ADTools MakeCode extension](https://adumont.github.io/pxt-ADTools/)

- [#HRMCPU Human Resource Machine CPU](https://github.com/adumont/hrm-cpu): inspired from the HRM game, I have designed a full CPU from scratch, that behaves *like the game*.
  - CPU design is written in Verilog HDL, the assembler is written in Python. Project is tested in Travis CI.
  - The CPU is synthesizable in FPGA, like the icezum Alhambra, or the ice40hx1k/8k.
  - A GUI developped in QT allows to run the code in the CPU step by step, and introspect every aspect of the CPU (registers,...)

- [DRAM module driven by Arduino](https://github.com/adumont/dram)

- [FPGA, Font, FIFO & VGA](https://github.com/adumont/fpga-font): project about playing with a font, VGA and FPGA, shows the content of a couple of FIFO on the screen. The project is meant to be integrated one day into HRMCPU to show the state of the inbox/outbox on a VGA screen. Using Yaml, Mustache and python to automatically generate the VGA modules in Verilog from templates and configuration.

- [CellularAutomaton](https://github.com/adumont/CellularAutomaton): several implementations of Cellular Automaton, in Logisim, IceStudio, and Verilog, synthesizable in the icezum Alhambra FPGA. Displays on leds, or VGA screen. See this Twitter Moment: [FPGA Project 2 - Cellular Automaton to VGA / Twitter](https://twitter.com/i/events/955588183252701184)

- [tplink-cloud-api](https://github.com/adumont/tplink-cloud-api): A npm module to control the TP-Link HS100 (and alike) smart switch, smart bulbs,... using TP-Link unpublish cloud API (reversed engineer). Written in node.js/NPM.

- 4 wheels robot

- [simyo_mqtt](https://github.com/adumont/simyo_mqtt): Pull your Simyo consumption data and publish them to an MQTT broker in Heroku

- [tm1638-mqtt](https://github.com/adumont/tm1638-mqtt): Interface a TM1638 Leds&Keys device (8 leds, 8 7segments display and 8 buttons) with MQTT using this bridge, written in C++.

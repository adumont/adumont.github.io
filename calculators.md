# Hewlett Packard

## HP 48sx

This HP 48sx was the one I studied with. I must have bought it around 1993. Before this one, I had an HP48s, which I then sold to buy this one, because it was expandible. I also have a 128K memory card.

It was manufactured in Singapore in February 1993.

## HP 12c

The HP 12c is the legendary programmable financial calculator of the HP Voyager series. In continual production since its introduction in 1981, it is HP's longest and best-selling product.

This HP-12c, with gold-colored plate, characteristic of the original models, was manufactured in October 1983 in Brazil. I acquired it in December 2021.

# Casio

## Casio fx-880P Personal Computer

I bought this one in Octobre 2021. It belonged to a spanish architect. I have the complete box, with the cover, cheatsheet, and the book (Spanish edition).

Although I put it here, it's rather a *personal pocket computer* than a calculator.

Manufacturing date and location are unknown (I don't know how to decode the serial number).

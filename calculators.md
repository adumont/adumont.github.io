# Hewlett Packard

This picture shows some of my HP's calculators:
![](../assets/img/hp-collection.jpeg)

## HP 48sx

This HP 48sx was the one I studied engineering with. I must have bought it around 1993. Before this one, I owned an HP48s which I sold to buy this one because it was expandable. I also have a 128K memory card and the original user manual.

It was manufactured in Singapore in February 1993.

![](../assets/img/hp48sx.jpg)

In 2022 I got a second HP-48sx with its original box, books and pouch. This one is subject to keyboard issues (need to be repaired one day).

## HP 41C

I acquired this HP-41C in July 2022. This one is a *fullnut*, *tall keys* model, manufactured in 1980 in Corvallis, Oregon (USA).

# Электроника

## Электроника MK-52

The Микрокалькулятор (microcalculator MK) Электроника MK-52 is an iconic programmable calculator from the soviet era. It was the first (and only?) calculator equiped with an EEPROM as permanent storage, allowing the user to save and restore up to 105 programming steps and 15 registers. It could also be expanded using ROM modules thanks to its ROM slot. It has a green vacuum fluorescent display (vfd).

The MK52 were manufactured from 1982 until 1994 at the Quasar and Kvadr plants in Ukraine. The MK-52 is known for having flown into space in the Soyuz TM-7 mission to the MIR station in 1988-1989. It was then preloaded with navegation programs and was meant to be used as backup to flight computers if needed.

{% include slider.html selector="slider_mk52" %}

I acquired this MK52 in May 2022. It came from Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. According to the serial number, it was built in November 1993. Along with the calculator, I have both original instructions books (in russian) and the schematics diagram.

# Casio

## Casio FX-880P Personal Computer

I bought this FX-880P in Octobre 2021. It belonged to a spanish architect. I have the complete box, with the cover, cheatsheet, and the book (Spanish edition).

Although I put it here, it's rather a *personal pocket computer* than a calculator.

Manufacturing date and location are unknown (I don't know how to decode the serial number).

![](../assets/img/casio-fx880p.jpg)

## Casio FX-850P Personal Computer

![](../assets/img/casio-fx850p.jpg)

This unit was produced in the TI Almelo plant in Holland. The manufacturing date code "155" printed inside the calculator indicates it was produced in April 1975.

It is perfectly working when powered with 3 external Ni-Mh AAA cells (1.2V). Only issue is the On/Off switch being a bit loose and will need further inspection.

The SR-50 belongs to the Texas Instruments Classic First Generation family.

## TI SR-50A

I acquired this TI SR-50A (Slide Rule 50A) in an estate sales in May 2023.

![](../assets/img/ti-sr-50a/TI-SR-50A.jpg)

Powered with 3 external Ni-Mh AAA cells (1.2V) it is perfectly working.

The SR-50A belongs to the Classic Second Generation family of Texas Instruments calculators.

## TI-33

This unit was made in Spain in 1979. Although it it powering on just fine with a 9V battery, it has the bouncing keys problem typical of these TI-30 family models.

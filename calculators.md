I love old calculators. There are the one I have:
- [HP 48sx](#hp-48sx)
- [HP 42s](#hp-42s)
- [HP 32s II](#hp-32s-ii)
- [Casio fx-880P Personal Computer](#casio-fx-880p-personal-computer)
- [Casio fx-7000GA](#casio-fx-7000ga)

# HP 48sx

This HP 48sx was the one I studied with. I must have bought it around 1991. I first had an HP48s, which I then sold to buy this one, because it's expandible. I also have a 128K memory card.

It was manufactured in Singapore in 1989.

# Casio fx-880P Personal Computer

I bought this one in Octobre 2021. Before me, it belonged to a Spanish architect. I have the complete box, with the cover, cheatsheet, and the book (Spanish edition).

Although here, it's rather a personal pocket computer than a calculator.

Made in Japan. The manufacturing date is unknow.

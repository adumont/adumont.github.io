## HP 48sx

This HP 48sx was the one I studied with. I must have bought it around 1993. Before this one, I had an HP48s, which I then sold to buy this one, because it was expandible. I also have a 128K memory card and the original book.

It was manufactured in Singapore in February 1993.

I bought this one in 2021. It was manufactured in Singapore in April 1992.

The HP 12c is the legendary programmable financial calculator of the HP Voyager series. In continual production since its introduction in 1981, it is HP's longest and best-selling product.

# Электроника

## Электроника MK-52

The Микрокалькулятор (microcalculator MK) Электроника MK-52 is an iconic programmable calculator from the soviet era. It was the first (and only?) calculator equiped with an EEPROM as permanent storage, allowing the user to save and restore up to 105 programming steps and 15 registers. It could also be expanded using ROM modules thanks to its ROM slot. It has a green vacuum fluorescent display (vfd).

The MK52 were manufactured from 1982 until 1994 at the Quasar and Kvadr plants in Ukraine. The MK-52 is known for having flown into space in the Soyuz TM-7 mission to the MIR station in 1988-1989. It was then preloaded with navegation programs and was meant to be used as backup to flight computers if needed.

I acquired this MK52 in May 2022. It came from Ukraine. According to the serial number, it was built in November 1993. Along with the calculator, I have both original instructions books (in russian) and the schematics diagram.

# Casio

## Casio fx-880P Personal Computer

I bought this fx-880P in Octobre 2021. It belonged to a spanish architect. I have the complete box, with the cover, cheatsheet, and the book (Spanish edition).

Although I put it here, it's rather a *personal pocket computer* than a calculator.

Manufacturing date and location are unknown (I don't know how to decode the serial number).

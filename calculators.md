# Hewlett Packard

This picture shows some of my HP's calculators:
![](../assets/img/hp-collection.jpeg)

## HP 48sx

This HP 48sx was the one I studied engineering with. I must have bought it around 1993. Before this one, I owned an HP48s which I sold to buy this one because it was expandable. I also have a 128K memory card and the original user manual.

It was manufactured in Singapore in February 1993.

![](../assets/img/hp48sx.jpg)

In 2022 I got a second HP-48sx with its original box, books and pouch. This one is subject to keyboard issues (need to be repaired one day).

## HP 41C

I acquired this HP-41C in July 2022. This one is a *fullnut*, *tall keys* model, manufactured in 1980 in Corvallis, Oregon (USA).

[![](../../assets/img/hp41c/hp41c_01.jpg)](/pages/hp41c/)

See more [pictures of my HP-41C](/pages/hp41c/).

In addition to the HP-41C, I also have the following accesories:
- HP-41C original pouch
- HP-41C Owner's handbook and programming guide
- Math I module and book
- Navigation module and book
- Quad Memory module (x2)
- Time module
- X-Functions module

### Magnetic card reader

In July 2022 I acquired an HP-41C magnetic card reader (HP 82104A), manufactured in 1982 in Singapure. Despite being sold with a label that read "useless unrepairable", I managed to repair it by cleaning it and replacing the damaged wheel with o-rings.

![](../../assets/img/hp41c/hp41-reader.jpg)

I also have:
- 5 blank magnetic cards
- the HP-67 Standard pac magnetic cards (no book)
- 3 program card holders, full of written cards (content unknown yet)

## HP 15C

The HP-15C was the high-end scientific programmable calculator of the Voyager series. It had advanced scientific capabilities like a numerical root solver, numerical integration, as well as complex and matrix calculations.

I acquired this complete unit with owner's handbook and box in August 2023. It was manufactured in USA in 1986.

![](../assets/img/hp15c/hp15c.jpg)

## HP 12C

The HP 12c is the legendary programmable financial calculator of the HP Voyager series. In continual production since its introduction in 1981, it is HP's longest and best-selling product.

{% include slider.html selector="slider_hp12c" %}

This HP-12c, with gold-colored plate, characteristic of the original models, was manufactured in October 1983 in Brazil. I acquired it in December 2021. I then acquired the book in April 2022.

## HP 42s

The 42s was the successor of the 41C computer. It was the high-end scientific programmable calculator of the Pioneer series.

I acquired this HP-42s in 2021. It was manufactured in Singapore in April 1992.

## HP 50g

I acquired this HP 50g Graphing calculator in June 2022. Previously it belonged to a spanish student in industrial engineering, who bought it from an electrical engineering student.

![](../assets/img/hp50g/hp50g_pouch.jpg)

## HP Prime

I acquired this HP Prime Graphing calculator in June 2022. I bought it from a student in economics who said she only used it twice.

![](../assets/img/prime/prime-booklet.jpg)

## HP 48g+

![](../assets/img/hp48g+/front.jpeg)

This HP48g+ was manufactured in Indonesia in May 2001. It has a black LCD screen. I acquired it in May 22, with the 3 books.

It was manufactured in Singapore in May 1995.

# Электроника

## Электроника MK-52

The Микрокалькулятор (microcalculator MK) Электроника MK-52 is an iconic programmable calculator from the soviet era. It was the first (and only?) calculator equiped with an EEPROM as permanent storage, allowing the user to save and restore up to 105 programming steps and 15 registers. It could also be expanded using ROM modules thanks to its ROM slot. It has a green vacuum fluorescent display (vfd).

The MK52 were manufactured from 1982 until 1994 at the Quasar and Kvadr plants in Ukraine. The MK-52 is known for having flown into space in the Soyuz TM-7 mission to the MIR station in 1988-1989. It was then preloaded with navegation programs and was meant to be used as backup to flight computers if needed.

{% include slider.html selector="slider_mk52" %}

I acquired this MK52 in May 2022. It came from Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. According to the serial number, it was built in November 1993. Along with the calculator, I have both original instructions books (in russian) and the schematics diagram.

# Casio

## Casio FX-880P Personal Computer

I bought this FX-880P in Octobre 2021. It belonged to a spanish architect. I have the complete box, with the cover, cheatsheet, and the book (Spanish edition).

Although I put it here, it's rather a *personal pocket computer* than a calculator.

Manufacturing date and location are unknown (I don't know how to decode the serial number).

![](../assets/img/casio-fx880p.jpg)

## Casio FX-850P Personal Computer

![](../assets/img/casio-fx850p.jpg)

I acquired this FX-850P in January 2023.

## Casio CFX-9940GT+

The Casio cfx-9940GT+ (also called Graphe 60 in France) is a powerfull color graphing calculator from 1997, in the Casio Green Classic series. It had 32K of ram, 28K for the user as well as an integrated Program Library. This unit was my brother's calculator when he was in high school. He gifted it to me in Dec. 2022.

# Texas Instruments

## TI-92

I acquired this TI-92 and its corresponding book in March 2023. It was originally bought in Oporto in November 1996, and served a mechanical engineer student there. This graphing calculator includes nice features like integrated CAS or a Euclidian Geometry app.

![](../assets/img/ti-92/20230310_132554.jpg)

## TI-30 Galaxy

This TI-30 Galaxy was my first scientific calculator. I got it in January 1987.

![](../assets/img/ti30galaxy.jpg)

## TI-52

The TI-52 adds base arithmetics and conversion, as well as complex numbers.

![](../assets/img/ti-52.2.jpg)

I acquired it in Oct. 2022.

## TI Business Analyst

Introduced in 1976 together with the entry calculator TI-30, the TI Business Analyst was the first in a successful family of financial calculators.

This unit was made in August 1978, in the TI Plant of Abeline in Texas. I acquired it in April 2023.

![](../assets/img/ti-ba/20230428_201219.jpg)

The Business Analyst belongs to the Texas Instruments Majestic line.

## TI SR-50

I acquired this TI SR-50 (Slide Rule 50) in an estate sales in May 2023.

![](../assets/img/ti-sr-50/TI-SR-50.jpg)

This unit was produced in the TI Almelo plant in Holland. The manufacturing date code "155" printed inside the calculator indicates it was produced in April 1975.

It is perfectly working when powered with 3 external Ni-Mh AAA cells (1.2V). Only issue is the On/Off switch being a bit loose and will need further inspection.

The SR-50 belongs to the Texas Instruments Classic First Generation family.

## TI SR-50A

I acquired this TI SR-50A (Slide Rule 50A) in an estate sales in May 2023.

![](../assets/img/ti-sr-50a/TI-SR-50A.jpg)

Date code reads 0976ACH, so it was made the last week of February 1976, in the TI Almelo plant in Holland.

Powered with 3 external Ni-Mh AAA cells (1.2V) it is perfectly working.

The SR-50A belongs to the Classic Second Generation family of Texas Instruments calculators.

## TI-33

This unit was made in Spain in 1979. Although it it powering on just fine with a 9V battery, it has the bouncing keys problem typical of these TI-30 family models.

![](../assets/img/ti-33/TI-33.jpg)

I acquired this TI-33 in an estate sales in May 2023.

## TI-3500

The TI-3500 was introduced in Septembre 1972 (see [here](http://www.datamath.org/Story/Datamath.htm#The%20Introduction%20of%20the%20Datamath)). I acquired this TI-3500 in an estate sales in May 2023.

![](../assets/img/ti-3500/TI-3500.jpg)

Manufacturing date and origin is unknown. I'd have to open it to find out some hints about it.

# Original Odhner

## Original Odhner Model 127

I acquired this Original Odhner Model 127 in May 2023. It was made in 1952 in Sweden, although it's based on a design dating from 1875.

![](../assets/img/odhner-model127.jpg)

This is a manual mechanical calculator, capable of doing additions, substractions, multiplcations and division. One can also calculate square roots with it.

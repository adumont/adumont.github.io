Beginners usually always ask the same question over and over again. This are some of my sewing tip that should help.

## Read your sewing machine instruction manual

Before starting to use your sewing machine, **read the instruction manual twice**, from cover to cover.

If you don't have it, look it up online, it's very likely there is a copy available as PDF.

Every machine is different! They look similar, they work in a similar manner, but they might have a little difference. Don't overlook the user manual.

## Threading the machine

Instructions on how to thread your machine will be found in the **instruction manual**. Read them carefully and follow them carefully, in order, don't miss any step. If you do your stiching will be afected and possibly it won't work as expected. One of the step will be to raise the presser foot! Always thread your machine with the presser foot up, as it will open the tension disks.

## Installing the needle

The same goes for how to install the needle. Follow the instructions in the **instruction manual** carefully. Of course, choose a needle specific for the type of work and fabric. There are denim, jersey, stretch, silk, leather needles... Needle can also wear and they will not work properly, it is necesarry to change your needle regularly.

Pay attention in the instruction manual on how to install the needle, especially on how to position it.

## Picking up the bobbin thread

To pick the bobin thread,just apply the same rules: Start with the thread take up lever in the highest position, turn the hand wheel (in the correct direction only!) until the lever comes back to the highest position. Gently pull your upper thread and you'll see the bobin thread will come up magically!

The trick is: your machine is a lock stich machine. When the take up lever is in its highest position the stich is formed and "locked". Otherwise, it's not.

## Starting and finishing sewing

- Always start stitching with the *thread take up lever* in its highest position.
- When starting to sew: hold your tails for the 3-4 first stiches
- Always turn the hand wheel in the correct direction, NEVER in the other direction: NEVER! (This rule is critical for some machines like the Singer Featherweight, but applies to any machine!)
- Always end your stitching, again with the *thread take up lever* in its highest position. That way the stitch is perfectly locked.

## Why is your thread bunching under the fabric?

You'll hear people quickly say: check your tension!, check your timing! But it's **unlikely** the cause!

The likely cause for thread bunching / thread nests, under your fabric when you sew are:
- the machine is incorrectly threaded
- the needle is installed incorrectly


## Sewing strech fabric

For stretch fabric you need stretch needles, which are special for stretch fabric. And possibly some stretch thread, like Gütermann Maraflex, which is like normal thread that have some stretch to it I believe. (It is not like the elastic thread that you'd use in the bobin only and will make gathers).

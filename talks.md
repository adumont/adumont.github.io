## SKI Calculus, Minimal Formal Computation in AlexForth 6502

Combinators were first introduced by Moses Schönfinkel in 1920. He invented and presented for the very first time a formalism for a turing-complete universal computation, 16 years before Alonso Church's Lambda Calculus and Alan Turing's Turing Machines.

In this talk I quickly introduce the concepts of *Combinators* and *Application*, and I define the three S, K and I combinators that form the basis of the SKI Combinator Calculus. Then I dive into how to implement them in AlexForth. In this first part we implement SKI and booleans.
